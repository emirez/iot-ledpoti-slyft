/**
* This is a Contionuous Integration orientation program that is written for
* demonstrating Agile Software Development Techniques in IoT.
*
* Designed especially for working with NodeMCUv2 with LED and Rotary Switch
*
* The LED works as an digital actuator according to data coming from analog
* rotary angle sensor. The analog input value from potentiometer makes LED
* on/off by looking its operating range.
*
* Digital and analog ports are used for LED and potentiometer.
* D5 -> LED
* A0 -> ROTary Potentiometer
*
* In sake of achieving CoAP-enabled control, the Slyft API is used for
* wrapping. Further reading: www.slyft.io
*
* We are ThingForward and we make programming for "things" in the rapidly
* evolving world of IoT simpler, faster, better and easier to maintain.
* Our comprehensive developer tools and support services ensure that your
* embedded devices get to market fast - making sure your company can profit
* from the full potential of IoT. Further reading: www.ThingForward.io
